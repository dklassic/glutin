### Try it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tauri-apps/glutin
cd glutin
cargo run --example window
```

### Usage

Glutin is an OpenGL context creation library, and doesn't directly provide
OpenGL bindings for you.

For examples, please look [here](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin/tree/master/glutin_examples).

Note that glutin aims at being a low-level brick in your rendering
infrastructure. You are encouraged to write another layer of abstraction
between glutin and your application.

The minimum Rust version target by glutin is `1.70.0`.
